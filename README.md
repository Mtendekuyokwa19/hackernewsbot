# A hacker news twitter bot
This is simply a hacker news bot that fetches trending posts from hacker news and posts them

## File structures
- It only consists of two important files and that is the `app.js`  and `get.js`  the rest of the structure 
has been left for future scaling
- It simply follows the MVC architecture but since one of the dependencies didn't allow me to have the logic distributed 
I had to put it in the app.js

## Tech stack
- Node js
- Express.js
- git+github
## .env structure
CONSUMER_KEY=
CONSUMER_SECRET=
ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
BEARERTOKEN=
## Inspiration and motivation
- I personally did not enjoy having to leave twitter to go read top posts on hacker news 
- I wanted to sharpen my backend skill
- I wanted to understand how those twitter bots which come to scam people work( lol)
